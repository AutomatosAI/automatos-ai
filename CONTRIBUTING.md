# Contributing to Automatos AI

Welcome! We’re excited you’d like to contribute. This is a concise guide. For the full, living guide see `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`.

## How to Contribute
- Open an issue describing the problem or proposal before large changes.
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch from `main`.
- Write clear commits and include tests where applicable.
- Open a Pull Request with a descriptive title and context.

## Development Setup
1. Clone via SSH: `git clone git@github.com:AutomatosAI/automatos-ai.git`
2. Install dependencies per README in each package (`orchestrator/`, `frontend/`, etc.).

## Coding Standards
- Follow the existing style per component (Python: PEP8; TS/JS: project ESLint/Prettier rules).

- Avoid breaking changes without discussion; maintain backward compatibility where possible.
